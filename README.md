## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure the recipe API server is running on `http://192.168.68.61:3000`
2. Ensure the API has CORS enabled (already configured in the server)

### Running the Frontend

1. **Simple Method**: Open `index.html` directly in your browser
   - Double-click the `index.html` file
   - Or drag it into your browser window

2. **Local Server Method** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
   
   Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### API Configuration

The frontend is configured to connect to the recipe API at `http://192.168.68.61:3000/api/recipes`. If your API is running on a different port or URL, update the `API_BASE_URL` constant in `script.js`:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://your-api-url:port/api/recipes';
```
